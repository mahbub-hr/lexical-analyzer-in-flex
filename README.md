# lexical-analyzer-in-flex

Lexical analysis is the process of scanning the source program as a sequence of characters and converting them into sequence of tokens. A program that performs this task is called a lexical analyzer or a lexer or a scanner. For example if a portion of source program contains int x=5; the scanner would convert in a sequence of tokens like <INT><ID,x><ASSIGNOP,=><COST_NUM,5><SEMICOLON>.
  
 cmd.sh contains the necessary command for running the analyzer
